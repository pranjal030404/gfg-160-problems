// Given n items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack with a capacity of W, the task is to put the items in the knapsack such that the sum of weights of the items <= W and the sum of values associated with them is maximized. 

// Note: You can either place an item entirely in the bag or leave it out entirely. Also, each item is available in single quantity.
