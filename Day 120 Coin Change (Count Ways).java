// // Given an integer array coins[ ] representing different denominations of currency and an integer sum, find the number of ways you can make sum by using different combinations from coins[ ]. 
// Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. Therefore, you can use any coin as many times as you want.
// Answers are guaranteed to fit into a 32-bit integer.
